# eliot-ai
Eliot is a Natural Language Processing application initially created to help users gain a broader perspective on current events and news media. It was built on the idea that people have a desire to see current events, issues, and news media in a broader context but that the current methods by which we consume information do not provide us this luxury. Eliot plans to help people remedy this issue by analyzing all major news media and providing a searchable index of major entities represented in that media. Then providing a high level overview of all that is said on that topic, including major points and distribution of rhetoric across all articles.
